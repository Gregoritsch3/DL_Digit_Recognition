# DL_Digit_Recognition
A Deep Learning Computer Vision project that classifies images from the MNIST Digit Dataset. The project demonstrates the use of three TensorFlow Neural Network architectures, ranging from a basic Shallow Sigmoid Model to a deep Convolutional Model constructed using FunctionalAPI. The project includes Error Analysis and Test Runs on custom images
